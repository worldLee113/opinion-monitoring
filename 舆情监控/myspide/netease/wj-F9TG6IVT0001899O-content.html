on China's fight against the COVID-19</p><p>Regarding the letter from Taiwan's representative about the response to 
covid-19 (March 28th), no one cares more about the health of our compatriots in 
Taiwan than China's government. The National Health Commission promptly notified 
the Taiwan region about the outbreak in Wuhan. In mid-January, as requested by 
the relevant authorities on the island, experts from Taiwan visited Wuhan for 
first-hand experience of disease prevention and control, medical treatment and 
pathogen detection. They also held discussions with experts on the mainland and 
expressed heartfelt appreciation for their reception and the information 
obtained during their visit.</p><p>Membership of the World Health Organisation is based on sovereign 
statehood. The participation of Taiwan in the activities of international 
organisations is and must be arranged properly under the one-China principle. 
Based on the arrangement agreed between China and the who, medical experts from 
Taiwan can attend technical meetings at the who, and the who can send experts to 
the island for inspection or assistance. Such arrangements ensure that the 
island's response to public health emergencies is effective regardless of 
wherever they may take place.</p><p><!-- AD200x300_2 -->
</p><p>Since the outbreak of covid-19, China has been open, swift and responsible 
in sharing information and the latest progress with the who and the wider 
international community, and is co-operating with other countries and regions. 
By taking swift and decisive measures to slow down the spread of the virus, 
China has done its utmost to protect not only its own people but also people 
beyond its borders. These important facts, and China's efforts and sacrifice, 
need to be understood and appreciated.</p><p></p>
